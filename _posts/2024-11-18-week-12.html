    In recent weeks while spending some free time scrolling through Tiktok and
    other social media I somehow managed to stumble into the
    <em>Starlight Express</em> section of them. While I don't often watch
    theater or musicals I instantly feel in love with this show just from the
    clips I have seen of it. The set and costume design is very futuristic and
    scifi themed. It also seems quite fitting with the recent discussion of
    <em>Koyaanisqatsi</em> as this show from what i gathered shows sort of the
    differences of technologies through different characters with trains with
    characters such as Greaseball, who is a diesel enginge, Rusty, a steam
    enginge, and Hydra, a hydrogen fuel car. Especially with Hydra's song
    <em>Hydrogen</em> which discusses the need for more renewable fuel sources
    both for trains and in the world at large.
