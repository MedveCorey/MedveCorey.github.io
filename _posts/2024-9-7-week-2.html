        <em>The Vanquishing of the Witch Baba Yaga</em> is quite different
            to movies and shows I've watched or games that I've played as it
            really just shows different communities and experiences of people
            living in different parts of Eastern Europe which is broken up by
            telling parts of a fairy tale in the form of this sort of animations
            about the Baba Yaga. The only things I could think of that are
            somewhat similar in a sense are games like those of
            <em>Assassin's Creed III</em>, and
            <em>Assassin's Creed Unity</em> where, while not really historically
            accurate since you are playing as a fictional role of an assassin in
            these different eras of history the games do include historical
            events, such as the storming of the Bastille, and information about
            these events that the player can read about and blends this
            fictional story into these historical events events to allow a
            somewhat documentary of sorts to the games. Both of these games were
            some of the first video games I remember playing and is part as to
            why I like learning random bits and pieces about history and
            mythology as, while not likely the best teachers of history, I feel
            give a relatively decent recreation of what the time/ experience
            might've been like for people living in there respective time
            periods.
