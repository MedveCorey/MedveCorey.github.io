  <p>
    <em>Destiny</em> and <em>Destiny 2</em> have long been one of my favorite
    franchises to play. The uniqueness bewtween the different classes plus the
    ability to customize and build your character virtually however you want
    always provided a fun experience. Despite rarely ever doing the end game
    content like their raids and dungeons due to never having a group to play
    with I really enjoyed it. Though recently things have kinda felt lackluster
    and not very enjoyable with much content feeling somewhat missing or
    incomplete.
