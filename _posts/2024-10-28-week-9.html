    One show I have been watching sort of on and off recently is
    <em>Power Rangers</em> more specifically Power Rangers Dino Thunder. It sort
    of started out as a community thing with the people from the Discord for one
    of the livestreamers I help moderate for and slowly becoming something I was
    watching more. It is quite nostalgic going back and watching some of the
    older seasons as I remember watching them as a kid and how cool they were. I
    don't particularly remember watching Dino Thunder specifically as a kid but
    it has been one of my favorites that I have watched recently.
