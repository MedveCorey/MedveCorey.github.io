        After watching The clips from <em>Apocalypse Now</em> specifically the
        Bridge scene it made me think somewhat of <em>The Division</em> Series.
        The lighting in the scene was quite beautiful especially with the chaos
        of the scene with the war going on. <em>The Division</em> and
        <em>The Division 2</em> does this similarly at times, with the player
        exploring and essentially liberating parts of New York City and
        Washington DC in a world just struck by essentially a pandemic and where
        gangs and hostile groups running rampant throughout the cities. This
        experience gave me a similar feeling as to watching the bridge scene
        especially with the fact that you're exploring cities that are rather
        populated and often hard to move around in real life compared to in game
        where they are basically abandoned other than the gangs and survivor
        groups roaming the cities looking for supplies to survivor and cars
        sitting abandoned in the streets.
