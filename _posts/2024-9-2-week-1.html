    In my free time I often help moderate a Twitch stream whenever they are live
    and for the past couple weeks they have been obsessed with the songs and
    music from
    <em>Epic: the Musical</em> which has ended up stuck in my head and sent me
    down a rabbit hole of watching different animations people have made for the
    music or watching people react to said videos. I always found mythology
    interesting especially that of Ancient Greek and Egyptian as they often have
    rather interesting and unique characters that have allowed people to create
    all types of different interpretations and stories around them such as
    <em>Assassins Creed Origins</em>, <em>Assassins Creed Odyssey</em>, and
    <em>God of War Ragnar√∂k</em> just to name a few.

    Thunder Bringer itself I feel is another one of these as it gives a great
    retelling of one of the major events in the Odyssey of th aftermath of when
    Odysseus's crew kills Helios's sacred cows. While in the traditional telling
    of the story Eurylochus persuades the crew to kill them while Odysseus is
    sleeping and results in the gods killing the rest of his crew and ships in a
    storm, Jorge chooses to have the gods play more of an active role in it by
    having Zeus himself appear and giving a Odysseus a choice in the matter of
    what happens. This change along some other things like how Telemachus
    fighting Antinous, one of the suitors, while his father is still lost at
    sea, provides a unique and different retelling of a story that has been
    round for thousands of years. It also shows how different stories can be
    evolved and changed over time to make a unique experience for people to
    enjoy.
