    After having watched this weeks screenings of the different skateboarding
    videos I began thinking about what things they reminded me of. While other
    games like <em> Riders Republic</em> or games from the Skate franchise for
    obvious reasons, <em>Sunset Overdrive</em> almost immediately came to mind.
    While it is clearly not a skateboarding game, I felt as if the game gives
    off a more general skater persona and feel that I often associate with
    skateboarding and skaters. The music in game provides a very upbeat and
    energetic feeling to the game. In addition with one of the main mechanics of
    that being on the use of movement like that of the ability to grind on
    things such as railing and powerlines. This ability lends the idea to the
    player to go out and mess around with it and try and chain from rail to rail
    or using other movement abilities such as wall running to keep there
    momentum going. This main movement mechanic is what made me think of it the
    most as i felt it was somewhat similar to that with skater and going out
    trying new and unique tricks that they could share with the world.
