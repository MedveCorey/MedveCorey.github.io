    I recently purchased <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> and it has been quite a fun
    experience. I have always been a relatively big Harry Potter fan and have
    enjoyed playing the game. It has its moments of both being somewhat intense
    while in combat in addition to plenty of puzzles and other things to also
    make the game feel quite cozy. I've been enjoying being able to walk around
    and explore both Hogwarts and Hogsmead inside the game and get to see it in
    sort of a different view rather than just from things such as the movies,
    books, or amusement park areas.
