    In the past couple of days I started playing <em>Marvel Rivals</em> since it
    has just released and it has been a lot of fun. I am usually not the biggest
    fan of hero shooters but it has been quite fun to play in my experience so
    far. While many characters have some similarities to other characters in
    games like <em>Overwatch 2</em> many of them are still rather unique and
    provide a fun experience with the destructible enviroment and the hero team
    up abilities. Jeff the Land Shark is probably been my favorite character to
    play thus far however there is still many I have yet to try.
