              With last weeks screening of JCVD and this weeks screening of the
              two Deadwood episodes it really got me thinking about one thing,
              John Wayne. While I feel most people my age have probably never
              heard of him it was a semi-regular name in my house growing up as
              my dad loved watching old western films and John Wayne's were
              pretty often among them. My dad and I would often watch his films
              such as <em>The Sons of Katie Elder</em>, <em>El Dorado</em>, and
              <em>True Grit</em> are all ones that come to mind. Wayne was one
              of the biggest movie stars of his time and to think in 1976, when
              he was 69 years old, he was still going out and making western
              movies where, while maybe not as physically demanding as some of
              Jean-Claude Van Dame's films, are still somewhat demanding
              especially for someone at his age at the time.
