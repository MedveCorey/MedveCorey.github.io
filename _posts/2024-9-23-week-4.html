              <em>JCVD</em> was a rather interesting film and got me thinking
              about other actors and such who put there bodies on the line for
              roles and jobs and with knowing we're talking about pro wrestling
              and Ric Flair in a few weeks a lot of wrestlers started coming to
              mind people such as Ric Flair, The Undertaker, Triple H, The Hardy
              Boyz, Edge, Sting, and Mick Foley are all names that came to mind.
              While many people often say "Pro Wrestling is faking" while yes
              parts of it are often times fake such as the rivalries and store
              lines told through out them in addition to often time the punches
              and kicks thrown in the ring. However, many of the bumps wrestlers
              take in matches weather it being hit with a steel chairs, stairs,
              or similar, while often times planned, are still very real. Many
              of the wrestlers I named above, while most have retired from
              wrestling, having being doing it/ did it for many years with Sting
              having just retired in March 2024 after having wrestled since 1985
              (39 years) and at age 65 it is wild to consider someone at that
              age still willing to go out into a ring go out there and put there
              body on the line in as intense job as being a pro wrestler.
              Undertaker also had a very long career (1990-2020) and filled with
              some rather intense matches one that sticks out in particular is
              from King of the Ring 1998 where Undertaker and Mick Foley faced
              off in Hell in a Cell.

              The match itself was itself is rather iconic and also quit fitting
              due to the moment portrayed of when Undertaker choked slammed Mick
              Foley through the steel cage. While the choke slam was planned it
              and Mick Foley was supposed to go through the cage roof except not
              in the fashion he did and Mick Foley ended up with many injuries
              from this match including a concussion, a dislocated jaw and
              shoulder, bruised ribs, internal bleeding, puncture wounds,and
              having several teeth knocked out. This match lead to Mick Foley
              considering retiring but continued to wrestle until 2012 but did
              not do as matches as intense with his character Mankind.
