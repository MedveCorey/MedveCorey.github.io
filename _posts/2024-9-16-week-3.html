              <em>Faces Places</em> followed Agnes Varda and JR on a trip around
              France and interacting with different people, and community and
              seeing how different yet the same people can be yet share common
              feelings and see how art can impact people and reminded me of one
              gaming community that I feel also embraces this and that is of
              <em>Warframe</em>. While often times communities in gaming can be
              rather toxic in general, Warframe I feel is somewhat a diamond in
              the rough as in my experience I've never really had any bad
              experiences with it. In addition to this it has so much content
              that people can play the game in so many different ways whether it
              be someone who enjoys playing just to make their character look as
              cool as possible, you like making your warframes as powerful as
              possible, or just playing something goofy like making a warframe
              that is as fast as possible just because you can. Additionally,
              the developers of the game are rather open with the community and
              as they usually stream once a week where they play with the
              community, short dev streams where they talk about things that
              they've been doing that week, along with occasional Dev streams
              where they announce things such as when new major updates come out
              in addition to always giving out stuff to the community including
              things such as the premium currency for the game and generally
              just being generous and kind to the community.
