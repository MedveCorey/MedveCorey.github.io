            <p>
              <em>Sambizanga</em> while I was a bit confused with the story and
              plot of the film as in the beginning it wasn't very clear up until
              about the last 45 minutes or so of it I reminded me a lot of when
              I watched <em>Cyberpunk Edgerunners</em>. While vastly different
              in terms of the story and style I feel as though both of them have
              a very common themes/ features with those being:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Corrupt societies from which the main characters seek escape
              </li>
              <li>Exploration of power dynamics and social inequality</li>
              <li>Characters driven by a desire for change or freedom</li>
              <li>Both end in a rather sad and unfortunate way</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              While it maybe was not as obvious at times in
              <em>Sambinazga</em> that these themes were present as it was never
              really super apparent, at least to me, that Xavier was working
              with the revolutionaries after later thought it became more clear
              and showed the escape that they were trying to achieve. In
              Edgerunners it is a more clear as the protagonist David grew up
              poor and after meeting Maine, Lucy, and the rest of there crew he
              is able to become one of the top edgerunners in Night City and
              while he isn't able to escape Night City himself he is able to
              give Lucy her dream of going to the moon.
